<p class="#">Hide and Seek</p>
<p>Everyone has played this one. Most parents have played
 with their kids, since hiding and finding is a common
 interest of small children. I've heard of all kinds of
 variations on this game. Sometimes you count to twenty,
 sometimes ten, sometimes one hundred. Sometimes there is
 a home base that you can run to and tag, becoming "safe,
 " sometimes you just wait to be found. The general idea
 is that one person is "it," that person closes his or her
 eyes and counts to a certain number without looking and
 then he or she tries to find the others. Number of Players
 : Ideally at least three. Equipment: None.</p>

<p class="#">Basket ball</p>
<p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most 
commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a 
rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of
 shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm)
 in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 
 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) 
 high to a backboard at each end of the court), while 
 preventing the opposing team from shooting through their
 own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made
 from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
 After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or 
 designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or
 three one-point free throws. The team with the most
 points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation 
 play expires with the score tied, an additional period of
 play (overtime) is mandated.</p>
